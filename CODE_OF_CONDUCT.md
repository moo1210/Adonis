This repo has 3 simple rules:

1. Use common sense.
2. **Test your pull requests, and don't submit something that doesn't even obviously work**
3. Don't send nonsense on the issues or pull requests, they ***will*** be hidden as spam, and you'll just be blocked from my GitHub repos if you continue doing it. I actually would like to be able to track issues and PRs unlike the real Adonis Repo.
