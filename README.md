# Moo1210's Adonis Fork
My Adonis fork that intends to merge pull requests upstream with modern new Adonis features.

The following features either planned or are in development in a branch: 

- [ ] Make Core UI elements (such as Window) work better with Gamepads, Consoles, and in VR, on the classic theme. (feat/improve-console-VR) (Unlike the other things on this list, this is a pretty quick fixup, and will probably have PR submitted pretty soon)
- [ ] Create the "Modern" Theme with Roact, esentially what was going to happen with Adonis 2.0's, but I guess since that's not happening, I'll make something for the current Adonis. Someone else seemed to have this idea, but it hasn't been touched for a long while, and it doesn't work, and has basically no UIs.
- [ ] Create (Or remake, if you can even call default GitHub pages template that exists currently a thing) a Adonis Website with a fancy homepage, and more importantly documentation pages that don't stink and don't confuse everyone.

I'm also working on a Adonis Plugin which I hope to make built-in, which is basically a revamp of F3X and Dex combined in a way, which can be seen at https://github.com/moo1210/Dex
