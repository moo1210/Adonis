# Moo1210's Adonis Fork
~~My Adonis fork intends to merge pull requests upstream with modern new Adonis features.~~
I just have noticed how poor of a state Adonis upstream is, it is a nearly unusable mess, most likely, for the time being, this will just be a fork of Adonis instead, for most of those major changes. I'll still merge minor changes upstream.

The following features are either planned or are in development in a branch to be merged upstream: 

- [ ] [bug/fix-linting](https://github.com/moo1210/Adonis/tree/bug/fix-linting) Originally intended to just fix linting, this branch now adds a swift full of changes to help fix bugs, such as adding stack traces to error logs, and fixes the linter, as well as fixes a few bugs too.
- [ ] [feat/improve-console-VR](https://github.com/moo1210/Adonis/tree/feat/improve-console-VR) Make Core UI elements (such as Window) work better with Gamepads, Consoles, and in VR, on the classic theme. (feat/improve-console-VR) (Unlike the other things on this list, this is a pretty quick fixup, and will probably have PR submitted pretty soon)

The following features are currently developed within this downstream fork and don't intend to be merged upstream, mainly due to Adonis's current state.
- [ ] Create the "Modern" Theme with Roact, essentially what was going to happen with Adonis 2.0's, but I guess since that's not happening, I'll make something for the current Adonis. Someone else seemed to have this idea, but it hasn't been touched for a long while, and it doesn't work and has basically no UIs.
- [ ] Create (Or remake, if you can even call the default GitHub pages template that exists currently a thing) an Adonis Website with a fancy homepage, and more importantly documentation pages that don't stink and don't confuse everyone.

I'm also working on an Adonis Plugin which I would like to make built-in (although I don't know if this will ever happen, you can definitely always install the plugin manually though, both on my fork and the normal Adonis), which is basically a revamp of F3X and Dex combined in a way, which can be seen at https://github.com/moo1210/Dex.
